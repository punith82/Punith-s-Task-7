## 🛠️ How It Works
1. When the page loads, `findData()` runs and fetches all users.
2. The fetched data is displayed inside the `#dataDisp` element as a list.
3. Clicking the **Reload** button clears old data and fetches it again.

## 📌 Example Usage
- On page load: users are displayed.
- On clicking reload: users are re-fetched and displayed again.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- **HTML**
- **CSS** (optional)
